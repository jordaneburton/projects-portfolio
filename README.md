# Projects Portfolio
Portfolio website to showcase various work and personal projects

## Description

For this project, I had to create a portfolio website from scratch. I was inspired by a few websites, but especially [Michael Kolesidis' webpage](https://michaelkolesidis.com/).

I had used CSS Keyframes to animate the header of my page. In addition, I used CSS Transitions to give my navigation bar some "pizazz", making the navigation "buttons"(because they're technically not buttons) grow and brighten up when the cursor hovers over them.

For the main section of my page, I have an projects section where I highlight my newest project as well as house my About Me section. Both my About Me block and my Newest Project block grow and brighten when hovered over. However, none of the project blocks actually have projects attached to them at the moment.

Below my main section, I have a footer that houses some links to contact me through Email and Github. It also contains a block where I give credit to any sources of inspiration or images.

Here is a link to the deployed project: [https://jordaneburton.github.io/projects-portfolio/]

### Known Issues

* Clicking the links on the navigation bar leads to a 404 error
* I did intend to have a wrapping ticker on the footer, but I wasn't able to finish it in time. I have made a Github Issue for it to complete it in the future.
* Clicking the links in the credits does not update the color of their text shadows. Not noticable to user, but still irks me!!
* Moving dots are offset ofset on phone
* About Me section is non-functional on mobile/phone

### Dependencies

* An up-to-date browser
